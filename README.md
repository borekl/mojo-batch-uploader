# Mojo Batch Uploader Experiment

This code was written to explore the implementation of a multi-file uploader.
It uses Flow.js in the frontend and Mojolicious (perl web framework) in the backend.
UI is done with vue.js.

This code is not meant for production.

## Running
Install the required libraries: Mojolicious and Data::UUID.
Clone into the repo, cd to the topdir and run development
web server with `morbo script/mojo_upload`.
